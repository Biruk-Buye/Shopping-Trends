Companies spend so much money on doing these projects but at the end of the and end of it you need to have some measures, which can measure the success of that project. So here, it could be okay uh after we have this dashboard will make some business decision that will help us save cost by 20..10% let's say or today sales analysts are spending so much time in merging excel files, which are coming from different regions and we want to save twenty percent of that manual time, or a simple metric could be okay ten percent increase in sales.
