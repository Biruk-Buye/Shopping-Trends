### Introduction
Hi there, i’m Biruk from Amsterdam, and currently i am studying Data Analytics at https://www.ironhack.com/ .I really enjoying learning this course and i am looking forward to have a carrier in this field. Here you can find the readme file about my mid project showing a customers shopping trends for a retail shop.

# Shopping-Trends
## About the project
This project pinpoints shopping trends by identifying the best product sold on different seasons based on category of items among different demographics such as: age, gender, area,  etc…

## What the project does
The purpose of this project is to give insight about customers shopping trends in a summarized form that can help managements for a better decision making.

## Stakeholders
The stakeholders involved in this project are managements, sales team, IT team, and data analysis team. All of our team are working inside the company. Meaning that there are no out sourcing.

## End Goals
In this project we want to achieve fully functioning tableau dashboard, which can give insights for management. This will help decision makers applying marketing campaigns for specific demographics based on the research in this project. With that the company might generate more revenue.


## Success criteria
After we present the final dashboard, the management are expected to make some business decision that will help the company to generate 30 percent increase in sales by focusing more on products which have low performance in terms of making less revenue. In addition, we are expecting to save cost by 10 to 20 percent from areas performing not so well.
